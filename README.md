# üå¨Ô∏è SpatioTemporal Wind Forecasting

An advanced Deep Learning pipeline for spatio-temporal wind speed forecasting using ConvLSTM, PredRNN, and a state-of-the-art Transformer model (PredFormer Fac-T-S). This project handles the entire workflow from data preprocessing to model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Multi-Model Architecture**: Implements and compares multiple deep learning models against a classical baseline:
    -   `ARIMA` (Baseline)
    -   `FCNN` (Fully Connected Neural Network)
    -   `ConvLSTM` (Recurrent-Convolutional)
    -   `PredRNN` (Spatiotemporal LSTM)
    -   `PredFormer (Fac-T-S)` (State-of-the-art pure Transformer)
-   **End-to-End Pipeline**: Automates the entire workflow, including data loading, preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
-   **Advanced Training Techniques**: Utilizes modern methods for high performance and stability:
    -   Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP) for faster training.
    -   Gradient Clipping to prevent exploding gradients.
    -   Configurable Optimizers (`Adam`, `AdamW`) and Schedulers (`CosineAnnealing`, `ReduceLROnPlateau`).
-   **Experiment Tracking**: Fully integrated with **MLflow** for comprehensive logging of parameters, metrics, and visual artifacts.
-   **Rigorous Validation**: Employs **Time Series Cross-Validation** to ensure robust model evaluation and prevent data leakage.
-   **Centralized Configuration**: All experiments are managed through a single, easy-to-use `modelos.json` file.
